SkillUp Backend Project

Database Design:

-- Created a comprehensive database schema through conceptual, logical, and physical modeling.

-- Defined relationships among entities to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.


MySQL Database Setup:

-- Established a new database using MySQL Workbench and configured a secure connection.


Express Server Implementation:

-- Created an Express server to handle HTTP requests, enhancing modularity and scalability.


Configuration Management:

-- Utilized the config package to manage environment-specific settings, improving security by keeping sensitive data (e.g., database passwords) out of source code.

-- Created default.json for global settings and development.json for development-specific configurations.


Database Interaction:

-- Installed Sequelize and mysql2 packages to facilitate ORM capabilities, promoting ease of database manipulation and migration.

-- Authenticated MySQL connection to ensure reliable database access.

-- Synced the Models using sequlize with MySQL database


Model Definition:

-- Defined models for core entities (User, Enrollment, Course, Lesson, Feedback, Instructor, Category) using Sequelize, establishing relationships with hasMany() and belongsTo() methods for relational integrity.


Middleware Integration:

-- Implemented express.json() middleware for parsing JSON payloads, streamlining request handling.

-- Developed an authorization middleware function to verify user permissions, enhancing security and access control.


RESTful API Development:

-- Created GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for all core entities, ensuring comprehensive CRUD operations.

-- Applied bcrypt for password hashing during user registration, enhancing security by storing hashed rather than plain-text passwords.


Data Validation:

-- Utilized express-validator to enforce data integrity by defining validation schemas for all entities.

-- Implemented checkSchema() middleware to validate incoming requests, ensuring robust error handling via validationResult().


User Authentication:

-- Developed a secure login mechanism verifying user credentials through email and hashed passwords, utilizing bcrypt for comparison.

-- Established user sessions with express-session, allowing for persistent user authentication across requests.


Session Management:

-- Integrated connect-session-sequelize to store session data in the SQL database using Sequelize, promoting persistence and enhancing user experience by retaining session state.

-- Configured session options (secret, store, cookie) to secure and manage user sessions effectively.


Why These Choices:

Sequelize: Simplifies database interactions with an ORM approach, reducing the complexity of SQL queries and improving code readability.

Bcrypt: Provides strong password hashing, protecting user credentials against data breaches.

express-validator: Ensures data integrity and prevents malformed data from being processed, enhancing application reliability.

express-session: Facilitates session management, allowing users to remain logged in across requests.

connect-session-sequelize: Offers a seamless way to manage session data within a relational database, ensuring scalability and persistence in user sessions.
